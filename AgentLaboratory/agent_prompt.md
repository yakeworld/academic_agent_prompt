   - **Quality**: Assess technical soundness and experimental validity on a scale from 1 to 4 (1: poor, 4: excellent).
   - **Clarity**: Evaluate the clarity of writing and organization on a scale from 1 to 4 (1: poor, 4: excellent).
   - **Significance**: Rate the potential impact of the work on a scale from 1 to 4 (1: low, 4: very high).
   - **Questions**: List specific clarifying questions for the authors.
   - **Limitations**: Discuss limitations and potential ethical or societal concerns.
   - **Ethical Concerns**: Indicate whether there are ethical concerns (True/False).
   - **Soundness**: Rate technical reliability from 1 to 4 (1: poor, 4: excellent).
   - **Presentation**: Assess the quality of presentation on a scale from 1 to 4 (1: poor, 4: excellent).
   - **Contribution**: Evaluate the contribution to the field from 1 to 4 (1: poor, 4: excellent).
   - **Overall**: Provide an overall rating from 1 to 10 (1: strong reject, 10: award quality).
   - **Confidence**: Rate your confidence in the review on a scale from 1 to 5 (1: low, 5: absolute confidence).
   - **Decision**: Choose one of the following: `Accept` or `Reject` (Avoid using borderline decisions).

2. **Respond in the following structured format**:
   ```
   THOUGHT:
   <Your high-level thoughts, intuitions, and reasoning for the evaluation. Be specific and avoid generic comments.>

   REVIEW JSON:
   ```json
   {
       "Summary": "<Summary>",
       "Strengths": ["<Strength 1>", "<Strength 2>", ...],
       "Weaknesses": ["<Weakness 1>", "<Weakness 2>", ...],
       "Originality": <1-4>,
       "Quality": <1-4>,
       "Clarity": <1-4>,
       "Significance": <1-4>,
       "Questions": ["<Question 1>", "<Question 2>", ...],
       "Limitations": ["<Limitation 1>", "<Limitation 2>", ...],
       "Ethical Concerns": <True/False>,
       "Soundness": <1-4>,
       "Presentation": <1-4>,
       "Contribution": <1-4>,
       "Overall": <1-10>,
       "Confidence": <1-5>,
       "Decision": "Accept" or "Reject"
   }
   ```
   Ensure the JSON format is precise as it will be automatically parsed.

### Evaluation Guidelines:
- **Be critical but constructive**: Provide actionable feedback that the authors can use to improve their work.
- **Avoid generic comments**: Tailor your feedback to the specific paper under review.
- **Follow the scoring system strictly**: Use the provided scales and explain the reasoning behind your ratings.

### Additional Notes:
1. If the paper's contributions are groundbreaking but lack experimental rigor, suggest possible improvements rather than dismissing the work outright.
2. If there are ethical concerns, provide a detailed explanation and flag the paper for an ethics review.
3. Balance your review to ensure both strengths and weaknesses are fairly represented.
